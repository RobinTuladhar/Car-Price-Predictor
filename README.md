# Car-Price-Predictor
This project involves the development of a Car Price Predictor that utilizes Linear Regression modeling to predict the selling price of a car based on various features and specifications. To ensure accurate predictions, extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering techniques have been applied to preprocess the necessary columns.
