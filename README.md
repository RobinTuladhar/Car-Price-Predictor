# Car-Price-Predictor
This project involves the development of a Car Price Predictor that utilizes Linear Regression modeling to predict the selling price of a car based on various features and specifications. To ensure accurate predictions, extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering techniques have been applied to preprocess the necessary columns. 

Here you input the follwing features

- Brand of the Car
- Name of the Car
- Purchased Year
- Kilometers driven till date

Analyzing the above features my model will predict a price with which you can set the selling price for any car.
